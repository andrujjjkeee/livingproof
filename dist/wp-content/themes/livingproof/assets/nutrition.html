                <h2>A healthy body requires a healthy metabolism.</h2>

                <p><strong>Metabolic testing reveals how efficient your body is at burning energy (calories).</strong></p>

                <p>Your resting metabolic rate (RMR) refers to the amount of energy expended while at rest, i.e. the energy required to sustain life: regulation of temperature, heart rate, breathing and neural transmission. This energy accounts for about 60-70% of the calories we burn each day. Metabolic testing measures your RMR, and will determine how efficient your body is at burning energy/calories on a daily basis. An efficient metabolism promotes sustainable fat loss and muscle growth.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>We use the Metacheck by Korr to measure your resting metabolic rate.</li>
                    <li>It’s a simple 10-minute breathing test; results are available immediately after completion.</li>

                        <p>WHY we eat what we eat is the foundation of eating behavior.</p>

                        <p>My nutrition counseling approach has been referred to as food therapy, due to my focus on my clients’ food and eating history (going back to childhood), their current relationship with food and their various lifestyle practices and habits. What we eat has a profound impact on our health and well-being. The new science of epigenetics is shedding light on this topic.  We literally are what we eat, but our lifestyle choices and habits as well as how we think have an impact on our entire being.</p>

                        <blockquote>If most people ate solely to nourish their body, food therapy would be unnecessary.</blockquote>

                        <p> Everyone experiences some degree of emotional eating. If we are ever to tackle the current obesity epidemic, why we eat what we eat is the main question that needs an answer. I derive these answers through counseling, an approach I call food therapy. Everyone has a story, and although these stories often spring from similar roots, we experience them differently and cope with them in varying ways. My task is to offer practical solutions to my clients by arming them with a functional nutrition approach and better understanding of why they choose what they eat and the implications it has for their health.</p>
