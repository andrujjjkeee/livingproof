  "text": "<p>Lisa Jubilee is a New York State Certified Dietician-Nutritionist, who has been counseling individuals on sustainable weight management and disease prevention for over 15 years. Her mission is to empower individuals to obtain healthy food relationships and to clearly understand the concept of food as medicine. Lisa chose to create a functional nutrition practice where what, why and how we eat are all part of the conversation. In 2005, Lisa co-founded Living Proof Nutrition Strength Pilates, a private nutrition, HIST (high intensity strength training) and Pilates studio, located in midtown Manhattan. Inspired by the growing prevalence of autoimmune conditions, particularly those linked to sugar, wheat and gluten, Ms Jubilee started a home baking business in late 2016 to provide a gluten-free, grain-free, low sugar cookie that fits into virtually any diet. Her mission to educate the public on the power of food as either health promoting or depleting continues with her Every Day, Anytime Cookie; Keto-Snaps.com.<\/p>\n"
